# Data Analysis Project: Understanding Patterns in [Your Data]

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project aimed at exploring and visualizing patterns in [Your Data]. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of various visualization techniques using the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
  - Conducted imputation, removal, or transformation as needed.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Gained insights into the structure and distribution of the data.
  - Identified key statistical measures and central tendencies.

- **Visualization Techniques:**
  - Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib for creating a variety of visualizations.
  - Plotted bar charts, scatter plots, line charts, and more to highlight patterns and trends.
